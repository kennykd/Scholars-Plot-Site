### 3.1 Architecture Diagram
Hybrid Monolithic (to be drawn in the coming future).

### 3.2 Architecture Explanation
The features of the web app are still in one codebase and uses postgreSQL with PRISMA for backend database handling, hence it makes our website's architecture type: Monolithic.

We are however using external services for our authentication with Firebase auth and we're using an external API for AI features
